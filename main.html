            <p>We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute-force method of problem solving. However, that does not mean that optimization is always the best answer. In this article, we will discuss brute force, optimization, time complexity, and space complexity and compare these methods. We will also discuss how to bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. If you are a software developer and are puzzled about both of these methods, this article is for you.</p>

            <p>CSS Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements within a container to be aligned and distributed within the container. It provides a convenient way to lay out items in a row or column and allows the items to be resized dynamically to fill the available space. This makes Flexbox an excellent choice for creating responsive designs. </p>
